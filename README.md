### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The feature that i felt most unperpared for is the load more feature. I dont really have an understanding of how exactly i am suppost to load more movies while keeping the already displayed moives but im going to search the intenet and youtube to figuring it out.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If i had more time i would finsh the stretch features more like the popup feature.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I feel like my demo was overall good. Something that didnt go as planned is the search bar, I unable to search with spaces Ex: All American.
